I think reddit's way of marking your current vote with colored arrows, which you can click again if you change your mind, is better (you may prefer to use shades of grey, or the YComb orange color for the 'chosen' arrow.)]",1184632694
34642,comment,34461.0,34629.0,0,0,mdakin,,,If you read my replies carefully you will realize that we are likely in agreement on many points and that you are putting words into my mouth.<p>As for the Sapir-Whorf argument the relevant case is not what the Lisp programmer thinks while programming C++ but what the only-C++ programmer thinks while programming C++.  Are there thoughts he is not capable of thinking because he has not been exposed to Lisp (or any other non-C++ language)?  I do not believe this is the case.  How would Lisp have been invented if only Lisp programmers are capable of thinking at that level of abstraction?  ,1184632537
